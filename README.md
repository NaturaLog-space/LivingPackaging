# Living Packaging
Live Packaging that Fruits! After you receive your package, spray your packaging daily and watch mushrooms grow!

- Edible mushrooms are harvested right from the live packaging!
- Spray daily and harvest the mushrooms within few weeks.
- Compost mycelium after harvest.
- "Eat your packaging"
- "Take a Bite Out of Waste"

## Mushroom Packaging Forming

- Molds of the packaging are made
- Pack packaging mold with mycelium substrate such as sterilized hemp, straw, wood chips, wood fiber, other cellulosic materials.
- For none food packaging, calcium hydroxide solution with straw.

## Self Healing Mycelium Material

During transit the mycelium may break if dropped. The gaps and cracks are filled with live mycelium material. Self healing property makes the package is intact after damage.

## Experimental Packaging

Hydrogel foam substrates for growing packaging material.

The Agar is blended into a hydrogel after setting into a solid gel.
The Agar is created into a foam containing liquid culture using a siphon
Charge siphon with CO2 30-70% and O2 70%-CO2
The stable foam is left for mycelium to grow into a mycelial mass.
